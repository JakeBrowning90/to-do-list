# to-do-list

I worked on this project over about 3 weeks, during which time I took a break for holiday travel. This meant coming back to my code after some time away and having to reorient myself! Fortunately, I was able to read through my previous work and use some comments to get back on track.

The key point of this project was to make use of a module structure in which functions are stored in separate files, and making use of imports, exports, and webpack to align the files into index.html page. I feel that I made efficient use of this structure, though there are certainly improvements to be made. I'll be revisiting this project to further streamline the code and make functions more modular. 

I've noticed that I've gotten hung-up over style decisions and overly elaborate functionality, so I decided to directly model my project on the quest progress screen from "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild". This kept me from getting off-track and bogged down by going too far beyond the scope of the assignment. The assignment also present the option to use the localStorage API, but I will save that for the future.
